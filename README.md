## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- Sass/Scss
- Flexbox

### Tested with

- W3C Markup Validator

### What I learned and continued development

- Sass/Scss: I took this challenge because it was a simple one as there weren't many elements to style, and so I could focus on setting up Scss files and overall working with Sass. I plan on using Sass in the future for more and more complex projects.
- Deployement: I learn to deploy with Netlify - until now I was solely using GitHub Pages.

### Useful resources

- ["Stop using @import with Sass | @use and @forward explained" by Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/CR-a8upNjJ0) - A clear video on how to link the files using @use.
